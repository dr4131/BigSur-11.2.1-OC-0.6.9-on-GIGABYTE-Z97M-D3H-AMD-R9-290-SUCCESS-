BigSur 11.2.1-OC 0.6.9 on GIGABYTE-Z97M-D3H /AMD-R9-290 SUCCESS!!!

Big thanks to all for various inputs which have enabled to build the rig
as below. Max time taken to fire up good ol' R9 290 TRI-OC-X 4GB SAPPHIRE RADEON graphics card.
But managed to do it in the end.

Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-Z97M-D3H
CPU: Intel Core i5-4460 @3.20 GHz
GPU: Sapphire Radeon R9 290 4GB GDDR5 Dual DVI-D/HDMI/DP TRI-X OC Version (UEFI) PCI-Express Graphics Card 
Audio: Realtek ACL892
RAM: 2x4GB RipJaw Ballistic DDR3 1600MHz
HDD: KINGSTON 120GB SSD
Ethernet: RealtekRTL8111 Ethernet

Boot-args used: keepsyms=1 alcid=3 -v debug=0x100 agdpmod=pikera -raddvi

WIFI - AUSHAÂ® USB WiFi Bluetooth Adapter - Wi-Fi Receiver & Wireless Bluetooth 2-in-1 Dongle - Works Natively
AMD Radeon R9 290 - Works fully 4096mb with a config mod
Intel i5 4460 - Recognized as i5 but all cores are active and good cinebench scores
Sound - Works through Internal Speakers & R9 290 HDMI out 
Handoff and iMessage - Works (generate your own SMBios)
NOTE: Turn off -v in boot args after everything works.

- Managed to get right installation in 2 stages
STAGE1: 
BigSur 11.2.1 OSX with OC 0.6.9 and attached config.plist (with original DSDT) settings for MacBookPro16.2.
(Clean install with Ethernet / audio working but only 7mb on R9 290 AMD card

STAGE2: Only for firing up R9 290 AMD card 
AFter above install Copy EFI folder for BigSur 11.2.1 OSX with OC 0.6.9 and attached config.plist (SSDTs + GPU Spoof) settings for MacBookPro17.1 settings
(AMD R9 290 now firing with 4GB) as complete installation was failing midway with the 'GPU-Spoof SSDTs' but worked as a charm when full EFI folder was replaced after Stage1 install.
